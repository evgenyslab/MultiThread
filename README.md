# MultiThread

A header-based generic example of multi-threaded queuing in C++ with examples!
The principle is to create a vector of threads that overload the functor operator of any class. To streamline method, an interface method is provided as a process class template.

Depends on BOOST library.


Example Usage:
```bash
# from project root:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
# build examples:
make
# run example:
./queueThread_example.cpp
```
